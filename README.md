# Giphy with React

This is a simple GIPHY search app that I created with React as part of [Le Wagon's](http://www.lewagon.com) React and Redux course. Supported by [GIPHY's API](https://developers.giphy.com/), users can instantly search for GIFs in this app. 

This is my first React App! :trollface:

## GIF 
**gif** \ˈgif ˈjif _n._ – **1.** a computer file format for the compression and storage of visual digital information; **2.** _also:_ an image or video stored in this format; **3.** using emoji, emoticons and GIFs in a texted conversation instantly signals the difference between sincerity and a joke or sarcasm.
